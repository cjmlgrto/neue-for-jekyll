# Neue for Jekyll

This is one of the early version of [mlgrto.com](http://mlgrto.com) that I made before I settled with its current design. Feel free to use this Jekyll theme and modify this theme as you please, but do credit me somewhere. It's compatible with GitHub Pages, so you can use this for that too.

## How to use

1. Clone this repo
2. Substitute the placeholder information within any of the files with your own
3. Run `jekyll serve` to preview your site locally
